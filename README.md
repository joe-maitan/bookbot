# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

## How to run the code:
Generic Python script that reads through a .txt file or any text formatted book. 

You will need to create a ```books``` directory to store your books in. 

Then to run the main program you can type:
```
python3 main.py <path_to_book>"
```
